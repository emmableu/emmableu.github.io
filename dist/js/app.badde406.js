However, a fundamental challenge of using machine learning for code classification is how to represent program code as a vector to be processed by modern learning algorithms. A piece of programming code is structurally represented by an abstract syntax tree (AST), and a variety of approaches have been proposed to extract features from these ASTs to use in learning algorithms, but no work has directly compared their effectiveness. In this paper, we do so by comparing three different feature engineering approaches for classifying the behavior of novices\' open-ended programming projects according to expert labels. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of these feature engineering approaches, we hand-labeled a dataset of novice programs from the Scratch repository to indicate the presence of five complex, game-related programming behaviors. We compared these feature engineering approaches by evaluating their classification effectiveness. Our results show that the three approaches perform similarly across different target labels. However, we also find evidence that all approaches led to overfitting, suggesting the need for future research to select and reduce code features, which may reveal advantages in more complex feature engineering approaches."},{"key":"wang2020step","type":"article","TITLE":"The Step Tutor: Supporting Students through Step-by-Step Example-Based Feedback","AUTHOR":["Wengran Wang","Yudong Rao","Rui Zhi","Samiha Marwan","Ge Gao","Thomas Price"],"JOURNAL":"ITiCSE’20 - Proceedings of the 2020 ACM Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education","YEAR":"2020","month":6,"date":null,"highlight":"One challenge with programming Worked Examples is that they are offered prior to problem-solving, and may not help students when they are stuck in the middle of problem-solving.

Existing, automated feedback can help students progress, but it is unclear whether it ultimately leads to learning. We present Step Tutor, which helps struggling students during programming by presenting them with relevant, step-by-step examples. The goal of Step Tutor is to help students progress, and engage them in comparison, reflection, and learning. When a student requests help, Step Tutor adaptively selects an example to demonstrate the next meaningful step in the solution. It engages the student in comparing ``before\'\' and ``after\'\' code snapshots, and their corresponding visual output, and guides them to reflect on the changes. Step Tutor is a novel form of help that combines effective aspects of existing support features, such as hints and Worked Examples, to help students both progress and learn. To understand how students use Step Tutor, we asked nine undergraduate students to complete two programming tasks, with its help, and interviewed them about their experience. We present our qualitative analysis of students\' experience, which shows us why and how they seek help from Step Tutor, and Step Tutor\'s affordances. These initial results suggest that students perceived that Step Tutor accomplished its goals of helping them to progress and learn."},{"key":"wang2020crescendo","type":"inproceedings","AUTHOR":["Wengran Wang","Rui Zhi","Alexandra Milliken","Nicholas Lytle","Thomas W.

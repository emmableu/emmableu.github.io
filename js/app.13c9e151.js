The Scratch programming environment is particularly popular, with more than 70 million registered users at the time of this writing. While the block-based nature of Scratch helps learners by preventing syntactical mistakes, there nevertheless remains a need to provide feedback and support in order to implement desired functionality. To support individual learning and classroom settings, this feedback and support should ideally be provided in an automated fashion, which requires tests to enable dynamic program analysis. The Whisker framework enables automated testing of Scratch programs, but creating these automated tests for Scratch programs is challenging. In this paper, we therefore investigate how to automatically generate Whisker tests. This raises important challenges: First, game-like programs are typically randomised, leading to flaky tests. Second, Scratch programs usually consist of animations and interactions with long delays, inhibiting the application of classical test generation approaches. Evaluation on common programming exercises, a random sample of 1000 Scratch user programs, and the 1000 most popular Scratch programs demonstrates that our approach enables Whisker to reliably accelerate test executions, and even though many Scratch programs are small and easy to cover, there are many unique challenges for which advanced search-based test generation using many-objective algorithms is needed in order to achieve high coverage.

Recent research has shown that novice students perceive themselves to be "bad at programming, especially when they do not know how to start writing a program, or need to create a plan before getting started. In this paper, we present PlanIT, a guided planning tool integrated with the Snap! programming environment designed to help novices plan and program their open-ended projects. Within PlanIT, students can add a description for their project, use a to do list to help break down the steps of implementation, plan important elements of their program including actors, variables, and events, and view related example projects. We report findings from a pilot study of high school students using PlanIT, showing that students who used the tool learned to make more specific and actionable plans.

However, a fundamental challenge of using machine learning for code classification is how to represent program code as a vector to be processed by modern learning algorithms. A piece of programming code is structurally represented by an abstract syntax tree (AST), and a variety of approaches have been proposed to extract features from these ASTs to use in learning algorithms, but no work has directly compared their effectiveness. In this paper, we do so by comparing three different feature engineering approaches for classifying the behavior of novices' open-ended programming projects according to expert labels. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of these feature engineering approaches, we hand-labeled a dataset of novice programs from the Scratch repository to indicate the presence of five complex, game-related programming behaviors. We compared these feature engineering approaches by evaluating their classification effectiveness. Our results show that the three approaches perform similarly across different target labels. However, we also find evidence that all approaches led to overfitting, suggesting the need for future research to select and reduce code features, which may reveal advantages in more complex feature engineering approaches.",authorship:"lead-authored",pdf:"https://emmableu.github.io/publications/wang2020comparing.pdf"},{key:"wang2020crescendo",type:"inproceedings",AUTHOR:["Wengran Wang","Rui Zhi","Alexandra Milliken","Nicholas Lytle","Thomas W.

However, visual and interactive programs include dynamic user input and visual outputs that change over time, making it difficult to automatically assess students' code with traditional functional tests to offer this feedback. In this work, we introduce Execution Trace Based Feature Engineering (ETF), a feature engineering approach that extracts sequential patterns from execution traces, which capture the runtime behavior of students' code. We evaluated ETF on 162 students' code snapshots from a Pong game assignment in an introductory programming course, on a challenging task to predict students' success on fine-grained rubrics. We found that ETF achieves an average F1 score of 0.93 over 10 grading rubrics, which is 0.1-0.2 higher than a high-performing syntax-based code classification approach from prior work. These results show that ETF has strong potential to be used for code classification, to enable formative feedback for students' visual, interactive programs.
